BcrWriter
=========

Library for writing GPS data files according to ISO 25178-7, ISO 25178-71 and EUNA 15178. 

## Usage
1) instantiate class;
2) provide required properties;
3) provide topography data as array by calling PrepareMainSection(double[] or int[]);
4) optionally produce a file trailer by calling PrepareTrailerSection(Dictonary<string, string>);
5) finally produce the output file by calling WriteToFile(string).

## Caveat
* `PrepareMainSection(double[])` multiplies the z-data with 1e6 (assuming data is in m)
* `PrepareMainSection(int[])` uses z-data unmodified (assuming data is in Âµm)

## Known problems and restrictions
* Most properties must be set in advance, otherwise no output will be generated
* `NumberOfPointsPerProfile` and `NumberOfProfiles` must not be modified during operation
